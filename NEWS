# `plotGMM` v0.2.2

## Tools for Visualizing Gaussian Mixture Models

*Note*: We are phasing out `plotGMM` in favor of our new significantly updated and expanded package, `plotmm`. Thus, this release is only a minor change including a note directing users to the updated package.

## How do I get `plotGMM`?

The package is released on CRAN. If you have any questions or find any bugs requiring fixing, please feel free to contact us either directly (see the `DESCRIPTION` file for more) or by opening an issue ticket on GitHub. Thanks and enjoy!
